        <h1>Part 1: Text Summary</h1>
        <p>The story takes place initially in Calcutta where one day the trio of Feluda, his nephew Tapesh and the
            thriller writer Lalmohan Ganguli are approached by Ranjan at Feluda’s home. Ranjan shows Feluda a photograph
            of himself with another boy when they were young. The boy was not Indian due to his white and pale skin.
            Ranjan studied in England before he met with an accident that took away his memories. He can’t recall who
            the person in the photograph is and wants them to be found. This starts Feluda’s journey of meeting a
            plethora of people and taking their accounts of their client’s past and building a story. When there’s no
            more information to be found in India, they travel to London to visit Ranjan’s school and college. They’re
            finally able to uncover the missing boy’s identity and his beliefs.

        <h1>Part 3: Meaning and payoff</h1>
        <p>The way the story begins, like any detective story, a reader has no idea where the story is gonna take them
            and what events are gonna follow. One of the main attractions of the thriller genre is that the reader is
            gripped by every event that takes place in the story. This creates difficulty in being able to see the
            complete picture created by the story putting aside the minute details. This is what my map aims to achieve,
            putting forward a summarization of the text through abstraction and using only the most important elements
            of the story, the characters. But it’s also not just the characters in isolation that’s important in
            creating this picture but also how each character complements the other and helps in completing the puzzle a
            detective solves. In this case, the puzzle was uncovering Peter’s identity. Here, the word ‘identity’ is
            important since it’s not just the face in the photograph which is already there but what the client’s
            relationship is with the missing person. Peter’s face is not seen in the puzzle since that becomes
            irrelevant when Peter’s own beliefs dictate that skin colour determines a person’s identity and most of the
            characters remember him as a racist.
        </p>
        <p>The people who helped uncover the client’s identity are placed at the left side of the puzzle and the right
            side for Peter. The characters’ proximity to the two figures also shows their importance in uncovering the
            identity and finally, the redness adds to the violent undertones of the story.

        </p>

        <h1>Part 4: Data Collection</h1>
        <p>The main emphasis while creating the map was on abstraction. For this, I began the process by collecting all
            the elements of the story that seemed relevant in summarizing or providing insights into the text. These
            elements were all the characters, relevant locations where events took place and, finally movements that
            capture the relationship of locations and the characters. In this particular text, there was an overwhelming
            amount of characters that hinted at what’s given a lot of importance in the story. Once the important
            element has been identified, what’s left is to connect the element to the identity of the story. For
            instance, the identity of the chosen text cannot be the fun Feluda and his group had in London since that’s
            not what the reader is reading the text for. It should be what the user was promised to be given, in this
            case, the identity of the missing boy.
