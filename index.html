        <h1>Part 1: Text Summary</h1>
        <p>The story takes place initially in Calcutta where one day the trio of Feluda, his nephew Tapesh and the
            thriller writer Lalmohan Ganguli are approached by Ranjan at Feluda’s home. Ranjan shows Feluda a photograph
            of himself with another boy when they were young. The boy was determined to be not Indian due to his white
            and pale skin.
            Ranjan studied in England before he met with an accident that took away his memories. He couldn't recall who
            the boy in the photograph is and wants him to be found. This starts Feluda’s journey of meeting a
            plethora of people and taking their accounts of Ranjan’s past and building the story. When there’s no
            more information to be found in India, they travel to London to visit Ranjan’s school and college. They’re
            finally able to uncover the missing boy’s identity and his beliefs.

        <h1>Part 3: Meaning and payoff</h1>
        <p>Genre of thriller has the ability to grip the reader to every event
            that takes place in a story. The way our story begins, like any other detective story, a reader has no idea
            about
            the direction it is gonna take
            and the events that are gonna follow. This creates difficulty in seeing the
            complete picture painted by these events. This is what my map aims to achieve,
            putting forward a summarization of the text through abstraction and using only the most important elements
            of the story, the characters. But it’s also not just the characters in isolation that’s important in
            creating this picture but also how each character complements the other and helps in completing the puzzle
            the
            detective solves. In this case, the puzzle was uncovering Peter’s identity. Here, the word ‘identity’ is
            important since it’s not the face in the photograph which is already there but what Ranjan’s
            relationship is with Peter and what Peter stood for. Peter’s face is not seen in the puzzle since that
            becomes
            irrelevant when Peter’s own beliefs dictate that skin colour determines a person’s identity and most of the
            characters remember him as a racist.
        </p>
        <p>The people who helped uncover the client’s identity are placed at the left side of the puzzle and the right
            side for Peter. The characters’ proximity to the two figures also shows their importance in uncovering the
            identity and finally, the redness represents the violent undertones of the story.

        </p>

        <h1>Part 4: Data Collection</h1>
        <p>The main emphasis while creating the map was on abstraction. For this, I began the process by collecting all
            the elements of the story that seemed relevant in summarizing or providing insights into the text. These
            elements were all the characters, relevant locations where events took place and, finally movements that
            capture the relationship of locations and the characters. In this particular text, there was an overwhelming
            amount of characters that hinted at what’s given a lot of importance in the story. Once the important
            element has been identified, what’s left is to connect the element to the identity of the story. For
            instance, the identity of the chosen text cannot be the fun Feluda and his group had in London since that’s
            not what the reader is reading the text for. It should be what the reader was promised at the beginning, the
            identity of the missing boy.
